# RAP Brain (Phoenix Version) ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¤

## Project Vision
To create an intuitive ecosystem for Hebrew hip-hop artists, enabling seamless idea capture, intelligent rhyme organization, and creative training. This project shifts the focus from technology-first to a product-first methodology, prioritizing the user's creative workflow.

## Core Principles
1.  **Creativity First**: The system adapts to the user, not the other way around.
2.  **Authentic Hebrew Rhyming**: Focus on phonetic sound over spelling.
3.  **Song as the Core**: The "Song" is the central entity connecting all elements.
4.  **Frictionless Capture**: A one-click method to save ideas from anywhere.

## The Workflow
The creative process is designed as a simple funnel:

1.  **Capture (Quick Capture)**
    - **What**: Any fleeting idea, voice note, link, or text fragment.
    - **How**: A simple mobile interface (e.g., an iOS Shortcut) that sends everything to one place.

2.  **Triage (INBOX)**
    - **What**: A dedicated view in Notion showing all captured items.
    - **How**: The user periodically reviews the inbox, deleting irrelevant items, and linking valuable ones to specific songs.

3.  **Develop (The Creative Studio)**
    - **What**: A dedicated Notion page for each song.
    - **How**: The user develops ideas into bars, with the system providing intelligent rhyme suggestions and easy access to related notes.
