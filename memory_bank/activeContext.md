# Active Context: Web App Implementation

- **Current Mode**: `IMPLEMENT`
- **Current Goal**: To build the backend logic for the web application, enabling it to communicate with the Notion databases.

## Summary of Progress
We have successfully planned the full web application MVP and completed the initial environment setup (Task 1.2). The directory structure is in place, Flask is initialized, and the `.env` file is ready with the necessary database IDs and API key placeholder.

## Next Steps
The next task is **Task 1.3: Backend - Core Notion Service**. This involves creating a new file, `rhyme_app/notion_service.py`, and writing the Python functions that will fetch data from and send data to our Notion databases. This service will be the heart of our application's backend.
