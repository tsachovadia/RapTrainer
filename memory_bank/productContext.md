# Product Context: RapTrainer

## The User
- **Persona**: A technologically adept Hebrew hip-hop artist and producer.
- **Goal**: To write and structure songs more effectively. They need a system to manage their creative process from initial spark to final lyric.
- **Key Behavior**: The user is constantly generating ideas—single lines, rhyme pairs, song concepts—but they exist in disparate places (notes apps, voice memos, etc.).

## The Creative Environment
The user has a specific, established workflow for freestyling:
- **Music Source**: A YouTube playlist (typically Jazz or Lo-fi beats) playing in the background.
- **DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)**: Ableton Live.
- **Hardware**: A microphone for vocals and a MIDI controller.
- **Live Effects**: The MIDI controller is mapped to control various audio effects in Ableton in real-time (e.g., reverb, delay, autotune). This manipulation of effects is part of the performance.

## The Core Problem
The user lacks a structured system for their creative writing process. Ideas are captured but not organized. There is no easy way to connect a lyrical concept to a specific song, track the words used in a bar, or group rhyming words together in a way that makes them easily discoverable for future use. This friction slows down the process of developing raw ideas into completed songs.

## Job To Be Done
"When I have a creative idea for a song, I want to capture it in a central place and easily link it to other related elements like the song it belongs to, the specific words used, and their rhyme groups, so that I can build and organize my songs more efficiently."
