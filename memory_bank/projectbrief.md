# Project Brief: RapTrainer

## Vision
To create an intuitive ecosystem for a Hebrew hip-hop artist that aids the creative process. The project's core is a sophisticated and interconnected set of Notion databases designed to capture, organize, and develop musical ideas.

## Core Problem
Creative ideas for songs—lyrics, bars, rhyme connections—are often scattered and disconnected. Artists need a central place to not only store these fragments but also to see the relationships between them, helping to turn nascent ideas into fully-fledged songs.

## Proposed Solution
A "Rap Trainer" system built entirely within Notion, based on a set of five interconnected databases: `Songs`, `Ideas`, `Bars`, `Words`, and `Rhyme Groups`. This structure allows for manual, user-driven grouping of rhymes and a clear workflow from initial idea to finished bar.

## Initial Focus
The primary focus is to build the foundational database structure in Notion and define a frictionless "quick capture" workflow for getting ideas into the system. Advanced features like phonetic analysis and audio capture are considered future extensions.
